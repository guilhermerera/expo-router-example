### Fetchly Dev Talks - React Native: Expo Router Example 

This small showcase project was created to showcase some functionalities from Expo Router in a Dev Talk @Fetchly.
The main goal is to show a little bit of the power, funcionalities and developer experience improvements that Expo Router can offer, focused on the file-based routing.

Design and colors are just for experimentation. The real focus are the navigation functionalities.
